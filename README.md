# CS 455 Final Project: React Native App

![languages](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/count/aquaigni/455-project)

**Welcome to my final project for CS 455: Mobile Computing.**
This project evaluates the creation of a mobile application in React Native.

## Take Aim: Defining Project Scope

CS 455 specializes on the design and implementation of software in a networked mobile environment, focusing on the challenges and opportunities afforded by modern mobile computing devices. The primary topics included software development practices, network computing, graphics programming, and human-computer interaction. CS 335 (Computer Networks) and CS 340 (Advanced Algorithm Design) are prerequisites for this course.

**This project is to be evaluated according to three goals and eight expectations:**

Goals
1. Demonstrate knowledge in a form that can be evaluated.
2. Practice what has been learned in a 'real world' format.
3. Extend knowledge and abilities past what has been shown in class.

Expectations
1. The project should be of sufficient complexity to require documentation.
2. The majority of this project mark is based on the github “README” file.
3. A specific software design pattern must be chosen, documented, and implemented.
4. Follow mobile programming best practices.
5. Mind naming conventions -- variables should describe what values they represent.
6. Respect the usual data encapsulation and modular object-oriented design etiquette.
7. Exclude libraries and variables that are not required – clean-up after yourself!
8. Comment your code! No matter how self-documenting, your code requires annotation!

## Subproject: BVxAndroid v0.5

**Description**

In 2021, I developed and sold a native iOS application using the SwiftUI framework.

Using the existing graphQL server backend, I intend to port an ultra-low-quality version of the app to React Native, to enable basic facility access for Non-Apple users of my client's business. Due to the public nature of this repository, I will not name my client nor identifying information regarding their work. The excluded SERVER_URL string constant and gql statements are required to build this app and can be made available privately upon request, for evaluation purposes.

## Installation 

- Describe how your software / development is installed. Sometimes it's easy as something like:

```bash
sudo apt-get install my-cool-thing
```

- often it involves a bit of  downloading sources and building:

```bash
git clone my-cool-repo.git
cd /my-cool-repo
cd /build
make
```

- You should list out steps as unambiguously as humanly possible!!
- Often people don't read the actual install instructions, but they just copy and paste what is in the black boxes. __Keep this in mind!__

## Usage

- Describe how the program / project is going to be used once it is installed. 
- If it is a command line app, you'll want to give CLI examples:

```bash
cool-project -arg1 -arg2
```

- then maybe show a screenshot of  the results :smile:

## Support

- tell users how they can get a hold of you

Contact: [email me](trevor.tomesh@gmail.com)

## Road-map

- List your panned future developments
- This is a good way to keep track of what it is that you want to do in the future!


## License

- Depending on what kind of project you are doing, you might have a specific copyright. 
- Usually on github, everything is open source!
- You can find license info here: [license](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/licensing-a-repository)

## Project Status

- A lot of the time people will abandon projects. You should always at least let people know if you aren't interested in working on a project anymore!
- Someone might want to pick it up on your behalf!
